- CareerVillage is a website or platform where students can ask questions about college and careers: https://www.careervillage.org/

- Built a more efficient recommendation system to send the potential professional the suitable questions, reduce the time response and the questions can be answered appropriately.

- Used Python (‘spacy’, ‘TfidfVectorizer’, ‘gensim’, ‘seaborn’, ‘matplotlib’) with text and natural language processing techniques, similarity metrics to build the models (Dataset:15 csv files, + 1 million records).
